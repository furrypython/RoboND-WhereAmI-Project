# Where Am I Project  
This is the 2nd project in the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program by Udacity.  

## Project Discription  
In this project, I learned several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:  
1. Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world  
2. Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
3. Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results
